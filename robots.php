			<H3>The Robot!!</H3>
			<H4>This is my Second robot. The goal here was to make a 2 wheeled robot that could log and
			map out the area around itself. I'm still not there yet, in fact I had my second kid and 
			really have no time to work on it. Also, I'm getting other ideas in my head that may cause me 
			to finish this one up to enough of a point ot call it done so I can move on.

				1st robot. I used an atmega16 chip and an H-bridge chip for motor control.
				There is an IR sensor to detect a wall that's not black.

				Without the IR sensor. You can see the ATMega and where the Hbridge chip would be if... I don't really know what happened to that.
